        - todo/done list numbering may be confused for old "merge" and "apply" rebase
        - drag and drop: could offer to cherry-pick commits even if only a ref was dragged (with log.dragAndDrop.draggingARefShouldAlsoDragCommit=false)
    - Rebase Interactive: cancelling the dialog might set selection to HEAD
    - when opening nested root of some repository, it was shown as submodule of the parent repository
- Notifications: some repository-specific notifications were not closed once the repository is closed/switched
- Refresh:
    - missing directory was not reported if obstructed by a staged file
    - possible inefficient refreshing for rebases with many TODO/DONE commits

    - remote, tracked features show up under remote and not under "Features" to avoid duplicate entries
    - remote, tracked branches are always shown
    - more efficient processing in case of many tags
    - after checking out remote branch, tracking local branch becomes selected
    - added option to group refs either after first or last slash
- more efficient detection of "closest tag" (for large repositories with many refs)
- Log
    - drag and drop for Branches view and Graph view:
        - to update-ref or reset (dropping onto other refs or commits)
        - to cherry-pick, merge and rebase (dropping onto the HEAD ref)
    - Graph:
        - clustering of customizable build tags (View | Configure Build Tags)
        - other refs (currently shown in gray) are not shown unless selected in Branches view
        - cursor left/right can be used to collapse/expand non-first parent nodes
        - dragging refs: added low-level property log.dragAndDrop.draggingARefShouldAlsoDragCommit to only offer ref related operations
        - Filter:
            - resetting filter selects previously selected commit
            - added low-level property "log.graph.filter.persistFileNameOption"
        - File log:
            - shows warning banner in case of disjoint history (as such histories are usually unexpected)
            - if file was renamed in root commit, log is rerun with rename target
    - Files:
        - diff banner only shows up
            - if diff is not empty
            - when swapping commits is useful (= if neither commit is reachable from the other)
        - files can be dragged to other applications
    - Repositories: show current submodule commit/ref even if not opened
- Output: shows finish time
- Push: don't report unchanged refs (like "git push" without "--porcelain" also doesn't)
- Refresh (Working Tree): warn if configured core.ignoreCase does not match file system
- Submodule:
    - Add: now also the relative path can be specified, not just the name inside the selected directory

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Log:
    - the selected refs in the Branches view and shown branches in the Graph could become out-of-sync
    - closed Changes view reopened if selection in the Files view changed
    - File log: disjoint histories might have erroneously shown up as connected
    - Branches:
        - Revealing Tracked did not work properly
        - Hamburger menu
            - toggling "Show remote branches in their Git-Flow sections" did not properly adjust category selection state (tri-state)
            - sorting with selected "Except for single refs" sorted single refs to the end instead of date/name
            - child options were not correctly enabled/disabled
    - Graph:
        - File log, filtering: doesn't use quick lookup of SHAs because it could report commits not belonging to file's history
    - Files:
        - order of diffed commits was not preserved after refresh
        - filter could have been preserved unexpectedly after SmartGit was forcefully killed
- background fetch: stops in case of authentication failure to avoid becoming locked out by the server
- Refresh
    - submodule conflict "deleted by us" reported contained directories as missing (because the submodule wasn't real)
    - after commands: did not work for UNC-paths
- startup: --log, --blame, --investigate did not honor --anchor-commit when checking for the presence of the repository file
- GUI:
    - directory input field: a relative path was absolutized relative to the SmartGit working directory (usually installation path)
    - docking: a long title (e.g. Changes view) must not cause a larger view size
    - XML syntax coloring: multiline parameter values were not detected correctly
- macOS:
    - possible internal error opening a directory chooser
    - right-clicking a control delayed the focus-event and hence showed a wrong context menu
    - Pull dialog: after expanding the options, they showed up as disabled

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- Changes view:
    - reduced git-filter invocations by 50% (important for LFS files)
    - expand Git-LFS files by default (= apply filters by default)
- GitHub:
    - added low-level property "github.pullRequestCommentPageLimit" to limit amount of fetched pull request comments
- Output view: ANSI sequences are ignored for better readability
- Branches, Graph: unicode characters (head, at-head, signed, subtree) are drawn as graphic because some fonts had problems with them
- SVN: shows more meaningful error message in case of network error
- Window | New Window: does not automatically reopen closed repositories any more

    - Graph:
        - Filtering:
            - easier and more visible options, easier reset
            - faster for finding ID
        - improved layout performance
    - Files:
        - shows banner when performing a diff (2 selected commits) with option to swap both refs
        - for working tree and index tables, columns "Last Changed On" and "Size" were added
    - Changes view can auto-hide:
        - drag Changes view on top of the Graph view
        - selecting a file, the Changes view comes to front, unselecting the file, the Graph view comes to front
- Refresh: improved performance
- Search/Filter input fields: more visible RegEx option (some filter input field don't have it any more, because not needed)
- Submodules:
    - Repositories: shows more human readable name for the Ref similar to how "git submodule" does
- Subtree support:
    - "subtree merge" command
    - "subtree reset" command
    - "subtree split" command
- Syntax coloring re-implemented based on ANTLR, because the previously used library was not supported any more
    - newly support "languages": ANTLR, bat/cmd files, CMake, InnoSetup, Kotlin, properties files, YAML
    - less popular were removed (but might be provided if there is demand and users provide test files)
- macOS: use monospace-digit-font hint for system font, so e.g. date columns get aligned correctly
- Windows: if Windows is configured to dark app theme, SmartGit's automatic theme will cause it to launch in dark theme, too

Fixed Bugs
----------
- Commit message editor: caret was invisible if at line length guide position
- GitHub: OAuth scopes were not properly set to access GitHub "workflows"
- Log:
    - Changes:
        - possible out-of-memory error when accessing huge file
        - Comment display: foreground and background colors were not configurable in theme
        - LFS files were not deflated, despite of "smartgit.compare.applyGitFilters" being set
        - connector between both panes were not reliable cleared when unselecting file
    - Graph:
        - possible unnecessary crossings related to Low-Level Property "log.graph.preserveConnectorsUntilFork"
        - working tree node and history commands were disabled if head branch, but not "HEAD" was selected in Branches view
        - when opening the Log for a non-head branch focus is forced to the Graph after a while even if the filter input field already was focused
- Move to Trash: improved performance for multiple files
- Refresh:
    - possible false-positive "unchanged" state for files changed immediately after staging

Other Noteworthy Changes
------------------------
- "Branch | Rebase | Abort" was removed because the more general "Branch | Abort" already covers it
- Preferences, low-level properties page: initially shows only modified properties (for easier reset)
- Windows: upgraded to Git 2.27
